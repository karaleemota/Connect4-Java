# Connect4-Java
This is a 2 player connect 4 game written in Java using mainly JavaFX. 
The players take turns to place a chip on the board, and the program notifies them when there is a winner
(a player has placed four in a row).  The program also has accessibility features such as narration 
and the board can be traversed with the arrows on the keyboard.
